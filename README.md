# Blueprint: Quasar + AWS Reference Project

**Project Goal:**  
Blueprint is a reference and demo web application built with **Quasar (Vue3)** and **AWS services**. Its purpose is to provide a fully functional interface to core AWS services, along with detailed deployment steps, code snippets, and best practices. This project is designed to serve as both a learning resource and a reusable boilerplate for web app development on AWS.

---

## **Scope**

Blueprint aims to provide:

1. **Interactive Frontend:**

   - Quasar-based UI to demo AWS service functionality
   - Forms, dashboards, and console-style outputs for testing service interactions

2. **Backend Integrations:**

   - AWS Lambda functions for business logic and real-time communication
   - API Gateway for REST and WebSocket APIs
   - DynamoDB and RDS (PostgreSQL) for data storage
   - S3 for flat-file storage and frontend hosting

3. **Core AWS Services Covered:**

   - **Cognito:** User authentication, signup/login, MFA/OTP
   - **SNS:** Notifications via SMS/email, pub/sub workflows
   - **API Gateway:** REST and WebSocket APIs to trigger Lambda functions
   - **Lambda Functions:** Execute logic and communicate with AWS services
   - **S3 + CloudFront + Route 53:** Serve frontend and manage custom domains
   - **DynamoDB:** NoSQL key-value storage for quick CRUD operations
   - **RDS (PostgreSQL):** Relational database for structured data

4. **Documentation & Recipes:**
   - Step-by-step instructions for deploying each AWS service
   - CLI/Console commands and example scripts
   - Lambda function snippets and API integration examples
   - Notes on best practices and recommended workflows
